}
This inheritance is not realyy adviced





        <body> 

            <div id ='book'>

While this method works, its not generally recommended for a few reasons:

Specificity: This rule is very specific. As a result, it can be hard to override if you need to change the style for a particular <p> tag that matches these criteria elsewhere in your CSS. The more specific your CSS selectors are, the harder it is to maintain and override them.
Performance: Browsers read CSS selectors from right to left. That means it first finds all <p> tags, then checks if they're inside an element with ID pen, and then checks if that's inside an element with ID book. This can be inefficient, especially on large documents.
Reusability: It ties your CSS to your HTML structure. If you change your HTML structure (like moving the <p> tag outside of the #pen or #book elements), the CSS rule won't apply anymore.
A better approach would be to use a class to style your <p> tag. This makes your CSS less specific, more efficient, and more reusable. Here's an example:

<body> 
    <div id='book'>
        <h1> hello </h1>
        <div id='pen'> 
            <p class='red-text'> Hello three </p>
        </div>
    </div>
<body/>
.red-text {
    color: red;
}
In this example, any element with the class red-text will have red text, regardless of its position in the HTML document developer.mozilla.org, codecademy.com.

The CSS rule #book #pen p targets the p tag inside the #pen element, which is nested inside the #book element. While this approach may work in some cases, it is generally not advised to rely on deep inheritance for styling elements. Here's why:

Specificity: Using deep inheritance can lead to high specificity, which can make your CSS rules more difficult to manage and override. It can cause conflicts with other CSS rules, especially when you have multiple levels of nesting or complex selectors.

Readability and maintainability: Deeply nested selectors can make your CSS code more complex and harder to read, understand, and maintain. It becomes challenging to determine the source of a particular style or modify it when needed.

Fragility: Relying on deep inheritance makes your styles more prone to breaking when you modify the HTML structure or class names. If you change the structure or add another element in between the #book and #pen elements, the CSS rule may no longer target the desired p tag.

Instead of relying on deep inheritance, it is generally recommended to use more specific class names or utilize more targeted CSS selectors. You can add meaningful classes to the elements you want to style and apply styles directly to those classes. This approach enhances the readability, maintainability, and reusability of your CSS code.

For example, you can modify your HTML and CSS as follows:

html
Copy code
<body>
  <div class="book">
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <div class="pen">
      <p>Hello there</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
css
Copy code
.book .pen p {
  color: red;
}
By using class names (book and pen) instead of relying on deep inheritance, you make your CSS code more explicit and easier to manage.
