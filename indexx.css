      <!----- ***** Flex Box ***** ------!>

      Flex box is a display typethat helps us craft css layouts
      much easier

      -The default behaviour of flex items in a flex container is that
      they strt from left to right

      -It helps us control the position,size and spacing of elements relative to
      their parent elements and each other

      - There has to be a parent container that contains the flex items
      - We can then control how this flex items grow or shrink

            <! ---- **** Benefits of flex box ***** ------!>

            - Easily build navigation bars and menus
            - Easily build grid layouts
            - Easily build bar charts
            - Easily build equal height columns

   <!------ ***** Flex  grow **** ---- !>

   This dictates how flex items fit into a container
   This fiting is dictate by the  number.
   The higher the number the more the space it occupys
   Here below The h1 fits in twice the space of div
   If the numbers are equal Then the flex item occupy equal space

   .div{                           h1{
        flex-grow:1                     flex-grow:2;
       }                              } 
 
     <! ----- ***** Flex Shrink **** -----!>

     This dictate how flex items in a flex container shrink
     The higher the number ,the  more the item shrinks
     The h1 shrinks twice as fast as the div

     .div{                           h1{
        flex-shrink:1                     flex-shrink:2;
       }                              } 


       <! ----- ****** Flex wrap ***** -----!>

       This is applied when the flex container is shrinked and
       the flex items cant fit on the screen.
       So the flex wrap make the flex items not fitting on the screen
       to go to the next line instread.

div{  ///This flex container is given 
       Flex-wrap:wrap; so that the flex items that dont fit are pushed to the next line instead
       flex-grow:1;  --This makes the flex item pushed to the next line , to occpy or grow to occouy the full width of the container
         
         .div{                           h1{
        flex-shrink:1                     flex-shrink:2;
       }                              } 
    }

        <!------ **** Flex basis ***** ------!>
        This is the same as min-width in that thay give the minimun
        width of the flex item,

        Note.
        When we apply flex grow(which makes flex items occupy wntire lenght of container)
        When we apply flex grow of 1 ,with min-width,the flex items all occypy equal portions of the container,irregarledres of the flex items min lenght
         When we apply flex grow with flex basis ,the flex items now occupy the container nased on their width/flexbasis 
        but min width remains stagnat and gives scroll bar if screen is small
        bt flex basis does not give scroll bar and flex items  continue to shrink
 
       Note .This is all done when flex container is in flex-wrap:wrap;
       and all flex item have  flex-grow:1;


       <! ---- **** Flex ***** ------ !>
       This combines flex grow,flex -shrink and flex basis all in one

       flex: 1,0,200px

       This is the same as flex-grow:1
                           flex-shrink:0;
                           flex-basis:200px;
